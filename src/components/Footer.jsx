          A body paragraph is any paragraph in the middle of an essay, paper, or
          article that comes after the introduction but before the conclusion.
          Generally, body paragraphs support the work’s thesis and shed new
          light on the main topic, whether through empirical data, logical
          deduction, deliberate persuasion, or anecdotal evidence. Some English
          teachers will tell you good writing has a beginning, middle, and end,
          but then leave it at that. And that’s true—almost all good writing
          follows an introduction-body-conclusion format. But what no one seems
          to talk about is that
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>
  );
